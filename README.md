# Project 3: Telling a spatial story

## Background

[SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/) claims to be the _'source of truth for places data'_ and they allow [college faculty and students free use of their data](https://www.safegraph.com/academics). I have [downloaded data for Marietta and Kennesaw](https://github.com/KSUDS/safegraph_data) that we can use to get experience with the complexity of spatial-temporal data. However, you can elect to pull data for your own location or Point of Interest (POI) type using SafeGraph as well.

As a class, we will identify a business purpose for this data.  Once we settle on a purpose, we will then finalize the project tasks.
