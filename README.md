# Project 4: Telling a spatial story

## Background

[SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/) claims to be the _'source of truth for places data'_ and they allow [college faculty and students free use of their data](https://www.safegraph.com/academics). We have data for Marietta and Kennesaw that we can use to get experience with the complexity of spatial-temporal data. 

As a class, we will identify a business purpose for this data.  Once we settle on a purpose, we will then finalize the project tasks.
